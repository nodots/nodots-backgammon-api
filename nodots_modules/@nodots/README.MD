## Overview

@nodots/backgammon is an open-source library that encapsulates standard backgammon rules with an easy-to-use API. It is also the library used for the game logic in the two proprietary projects that make up Nodots Backgammon:

### Nodots Backgammon RESTful API (Est launch: Sept 2024)

If you would like access to this project, please PM me.

### Nodots Backgammon Client (Est launch: Oct 2024)

ðŸ”— [Git](https://github.com/nodots/nodots-backgammon-client)

React client that scales beautifully from smart phone to smart TV and implements best practices in UX for limiting eye-strain in environments where users are staring at the screen for way longer than they should. Backgammon players, for example.

## Features

- Logic for creating players from very basic json input. You can build your very own API or app with this.
- Logic for ~~all~~ most aspects of game play using standard rules for single-game play.
- Leverages [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) to make it easy to work with your preferred data store.
